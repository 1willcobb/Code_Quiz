# Code_Quiz
A quiz for coding in JS

## Challange

I was challenged to make a code quiz that is a series of questions that must be completed in an alloted time. It was to capture High Scores entered and have a HS page.

## How it works

There are 10 questions and 30 seconds on the clock. 

Each time the game starts the questions are jumbled and random ordered. 

Every answer wrong displays right or wrong. if wrong, 5 seconds are deducted from the time. if right, 1 point is added to the score. 

Once time is out, or all 10 questions are answered the game is over and the user is prompted to provide their initials. 

initials are tracked in localStorage for that computer and pulled after the initials are entered or after the "view high scores" button is pressed. 

A reset button was added to clear all high scores.

## Features

I tried to go above and beyond the assignment by making classes for adding new questions easier. 

## Future Features

I really wanted to add in a way to append new questions from user input with a button at the top or something. I could do this but I am moving on to the next project and may come back at some time. 

I also styled this simply to be closer to the mockup. I would have liked to style it further. 

## What I Learned

Really enjoyed how complex this was and it was cool to see how to organize an actual large scale project like this. I wish I organized the JS a little better but it works!
